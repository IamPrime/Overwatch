 Food Analysis Web App
 Food is essential to every living thing on our planet for daily survival, strength, energy and health. As a human, we usually do not keep track of the nutrition in our food, even though as a species we have technologically advanced, still it is difficult to keep track of the nutrition value of the foods we consume. This simple application can help you keep track of the foods you consume and give you an almost instant nutrition fact check by consuming 2 different APIs.
This application is inspired by Munch and powered by the Clarifai API â€“ food detection model and the Wolfram Alpha Food Nutrition Calculator.
